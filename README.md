Instructions for pairing:

 Step 1: Pair controler in the Bluetooth Manager on the top bar and make sure your first step is "Add" or "Add device".

 Step 2: once paired correctly proceed to the next step.

 Step 3: Now its kinda paired but not really (dont worry you dont have to do that last step everytime).

 Step 4: Open Terminal and type: ds4drv and hit enter, hold Option and the middle button on the controller once the controller starts flashing you have finished the pairing process.

 Step 5: (Optional) switch to XBox mode by holding R1 L1 and the middle button. This mode offer more compatibility in games.
